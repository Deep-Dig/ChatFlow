Set up a basic React project with Redux and React Router.
Create a search component that allows users to search for movies using the Open Movie
Database API (OMDb).
Display the search results in a list format, showing the movie title, year, and poster.
Create a movie detail component that shows the full details of a selected movie, including
the plot, rating, runtime, and cast.
Use Redux to manage the state of the app, including the search results and the currently
selected movie.
Use React Router to create a movie detail page that displays the selected movie&#39;s details
when the user clicks on a movie from the search results.
Add additional features such as pagination for search results, sorting options, and filters.
Style the app using CSS and/or a CSS framework such as Bootstrap.
